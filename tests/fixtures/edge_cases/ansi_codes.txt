  [1m# aws_s3_bucket.test will be created[0m[0m
  [0m[32m+[0m[0m resource "aws_s3_bucket" "test" {
      [32m+[0m[0m arn                         = (known after apply)
      [32m+[0m[0m bucket                      = "test-bucket-with-ansi"
      [32m+[0m[0m id                          = (known after apply)
      [32m+[0m[0m tags                        = {
          [32m+[0m[0m "Environment" = "[32mproduction[0m"
          [32m+[0m[0m "Name"        = "[1mTestBucket[0m"
